	<p>As we make moves to create a more sustainable future for our guests, team members and the planet, we’ve reached a major milestone: We just completed our 500th rooftop solar installation.</p>

<p>The accomplishment shows that Target’s leading the way when it comes to solar energy. Back in 2015, we made the promise to add rooftop solar panels to 500 locations by 2020. This month, we reached our goal ahead of schedule. It’s just one sign we’re making big progress toward our ambitious climate goals, which include commitments across our entire supply chain to reduce our carbon footprint. For example, we’re already a quarter of the way toward our goal of having 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030—a commitment we made just last summer.</p>

	“At Target, we’re committed to making our operations even more sustainable to create a better future for our guests, team members and the planet,” says John Leisen, VP of Property Management, Target. “Ambitious energy goals have helped us accelerate our progress and reach major milestones. And we’ll continue to invest in technologies, partners and resources to help us achieve even more.”

	Our most recent installation on the roof of our Napa, California, store represents our 500th location with onsite solar across our stores and distribution centers. In total, they’ve helped us add more than 240 megawatts of solar across our buildings, equivalent to powering nearly 46,000 homes in the U.S. Why solar? Meeting energy needs through solar is good for communities and the environment, and it also helps us reduce costs. A rooftop solar project generates enough energy to offset between 15 and 40% of a property’s energy needs.

	“For years, Target has led the way on corporate solar adoption, helping to create a cultural shift in how top companies power their operations,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “Companies such as Target have the power to make lasting change and we’re thrilled to see Target double down on their commitment to solar energy.”

We were honored by SEIA as a top U.S. corporate installer for five years in a row, taking the number one spot for on-site installations in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Over the past five years, Target has installed more solar systems than any other company, according to data from SEIA’s Solar Means Business report. We’re also proud to be a 4-time ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year.
